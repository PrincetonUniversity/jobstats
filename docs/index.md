# What is Jobstats?

Jobstats is a free and open-source job monitoring platform designed for CPU and GPU clusters that use the Slurm workload manager. It was released in 2023 under the GNU GPL v2 license. Visit the [Jobstats GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/jobstats).

## What are the main benefits of Jobstats over other platforms?

The main advantages of Jobstats are:

- no action is required by the user 
- utilization and memory usage for each allocated GPU
- automatically cancel jobs with 0% GPU utilization ([more info](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/job_defense_shield/))
- accurate CPU memory usage for jobs of any size
- graphical interface for inspecting job metrics versus time
- efficiency reports contain job-specific notes to guide users
- automated emails to users for instances of underutilization ([more info](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/job_defense_shield/))
- periodic reports on usage and efficiency for users and group leaders
- all of the above features work with Open OnDemand jobs

## How does Jobstats work?

A schematic diagram of the components of the Jobstats platform and the external tools is shown below:

![Schematic diagram](jobstats_schematics.png)

A compute node with two sockets is shown in the upper left. The dotted line around the node indicates the three node-level exporters, namely, Node, cgroups and NVIDIA. A GPFS server is shown in the upper right with its cluster-level GPFS exporter. The exporters serve to make data available to the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) database. Users interact with the Prometheus and Slurm data via the web interface (i.e., [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)) and external tools (e.g., `jobstats`).

                                     Notes
================================================================================
  * This job only used 6% of the 256GB of total allocated CPU memory. For
    future jobs, please allocate less memory by using a Slurm directive such
    as --mem-per-cpu=1G or --mem=10G. This will reduce your queue times and
    make the resources available to other users. For more info:
