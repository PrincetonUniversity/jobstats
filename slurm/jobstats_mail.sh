#### JOB_COMPLETION_TIME ###
# The time needed for job to complete and synchronize accounting data with
# slurmdbd. If you're running slurmctld under systemd control executing
# `systemctl stop slurmctld` or `systemctl restart slurmctld` may hang for this
# time. While slurmctld will be down systemd will still waits for all
# descendant processes (in this case sleep executed from smail) to complete.
# The default value is 5s (half of default MessageTimeout)
